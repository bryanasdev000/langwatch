A distrowatch for programming languages!

## Why?

Because I failed to find something like it on the internet, I also like Distrowatch.

## TODO (Just a idea for now)

- Index with basic information (categories) about the language
- TIOBE/Stackoverflow/PYPL Ranking
- Latest news from X language (with help from community)
- Map any other feature that I have forgotten
- Hello world in X language
- Syntax example
- Something similar to Distrochooser or LibreHunt to recommend the first programming language.
